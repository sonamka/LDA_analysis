    Designing and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) tools in agriculture represents an exciting opportunity for international collaboration, uniting diverse expertise and resources to tackle global challenges. Our project aims to impact agriculture by developing, deploying, and democratizing AI tools to help farmers manage pests and stressors more effectively, making farming less risky, more profitable, and more sustainable. We plan to create AI-driven tools that provide personalized management advice, enhance crop yields, and support sustainable farming practices. This initiative will bring together scientists and practitioners from the US, India, and Japan, fostering international collaboration and innovation. The AI-driven approaches will benefit small and medium-sized farmers, offering easy-to-use, accessible technology to help them pursue climate-smart agriculture. The project also includes educational components and multilateral engagements to inspire the next generation of agricultural and AI experts. This EAGER project seeks to pursue multilateral research partnerships between the US, India, and Japan to develop and deploy AI-driven tools to enhance agricultural productivity. This team will work across two areas of collaborative effort: (i) developing hybrid machine learning models that combine sensor (proximal and remote) data with biophysical knowledge for yield and stress prediction, and (ii) utilizing agronomic data -- both biotic (insects, weeds, diseases) and abiotic (nutrient deficiencies, herbicide injury) -- to fine-tune and deploy large vision and language models developed by AIIRA (one of the five NIFA-funded National AI Institutes) in the US, led by Iowa State University (ISU). By collaborating with international partners that span diverse environments, we aim to develop and validate a robust, scalable framework for agricultural management that supports real-time decision-making and fosters sustainable agricultural practices globally. The initiative also emphasizes educational outreach, promoting interdisciplinary learning and broadening participation in AI-driven agriculture. This project is funded as part of the Quad AI-ENGAGE initiative, a collaboration of the National Science Foundation, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and Japan Science and Technology Agency to advance innovation to empower next generation agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Agriculture faces increasing challenges all around the world in the face of climate-change related issues. A new focus on climate smart agriculture catalyzed by developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence will be needed to better manage complex agricultural cyber-physical systems to maintain productivity to ensure food security while constraining the impact that agriculture has on greenhouse gas emissions. This proposal is to provide support for U.S. participation in a workshop on Internet of things (IoT)/artificial intelligence(AI)/machine learning (ML)-enabled precision agriculture to be hosted by Ben-Gurion University at Beer-Sheva in July 2023. The focus will be on big data acquisition and AI/ML-based analytics in precision agriculture. It will cover a wide range of topics focused on scoping of the key challenges remaining in how to use IoT/AI/ML to support further development of sustainable agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Sustained intensification in agricultural production to meet the caloric needs of a rapidly increasing population, and to do so while combating the impacts of climate change â€“ are two major grand challenges in 21st century agriculture. This project creates a three-way collaboration between the AgAID Institute (one of the five NIFA-funded AI Institutes) in the US led by Washington State University (WSU), the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and IIT-B Technology Innovation Hub (TIH) in India, and the University of Tokyo in Japan â€“ with a vision to include Australian research networks in the longer term. We will develop collaborative research plan using AI/ML methods and frameworks to improve agricultural and climate resilience in Indian agriculture. The proposed project will target two major scientific goals: 1) Build and test new AI-enabled infrastructure for in-field crop monitoring and phenotyping, with a focus on technology transfer across agricultural testbeds. 2) Develop and integrate AI-enabled soil water balance models for improved climate resilience and optimized water resource management in farms, to improve reliable estimation of soil moisture and other related soil-water balance measures at the farm scale. Crop monitoring and phenotyping are key technologies in precision agriculture that play a critical role for both on-farm, real-time decision support as well as in the development of new crop varieties optimized for important traits (e.g., yield, drought resistance, disease resistance). Furthermore, developing new predictive capabilities for key variables associated with soil and water is also vital for robust agricultural decision support. This project will investigate ways to test the transfer of AI-driven sensing technologies and edge-to-cloud workflows for potential deployment in rural Indian agriculture conditions. Toward predictive AI capabilities, this project will investigate the development of data-driven models for efficient water resource management, at a regional and farm scale. Innovations are expected for both the technology side â€“ development of scalable and affordable farm IoT technologies â€“ and the use-inspired AI side â€“ new data-driven machine learning models that couple scientific models with observable data toward robust real-time and site-specific decision support. The choice of problems and the proposed approach through AI have global scope and relevance to extend to other similar semi-arid geographies. This project is funded as part of the Quad AI-ENGAGE initiative, a collaboration of the National Science Foundation, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and Japan Science and Technology Agency to advance innovation to empower next generation agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology HBCU Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (CREST HBCU-RISE), this project aims to improve the theoretical Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure at Tennessee State University (TSU) for addressing important data science challenges. While AI applications have proliferated, there remains a gap in the fundamental mathematical theories required to construct reliable and secure AI systems suitable for safety-critical applications. This project seeks to address this. The expected outcomes include the advancement of scientific knowledge in AI theory and its practical applications in cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and agriculture. Additionally, this project aims to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration, promote broader participation in STEM fields, and strengthen research competitiveness at TSU. The overarching goal is to advance research capabilities in emerging AI areas and develop a comprehensive approach to educate and train Ph.D. students in collaboration with three TSU colleges: Engineering, Life and Physical Sciences, and Agriculture. The research will develop mathematical theory and practical algorithms for accurate and robust machine learning that can be applied for advancing research in privacy-preserving AI, protein structure modeling with enhanced cryo-electron microscopy imaging, and optimal feature selection for precision agriculture. High-dimensional manifold geometries for neural networks training, network linearization for homomorphic encryption in private AI, systematic integration of subspace segmentation and machine learning for cryo-electron microscopy, and quality assessment of multi-scale sensing data for crop parameters and yield estimation will be investigated. This project implements a coherent curriculum across three colleges for AI education, which includes developing educational materials, organizing professional development activities for students, providing Ph.D. student mentoring, and procuring research equipment to support this research. The CREST HBCU-RISE program supports the expansion of institutional research capacity as well as the successful training of doctoral students in STEM at HBCUs. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Global food supply and food security are at risk due to an increasing world population, climate change, diminishing natural resources, and limited available land. In agriculture, the primary challenge has been how to be more productive with less - less arable land, less water, less labor, less certainty. In arid lands, these challenges are amplified. Agricultural systems struggle to cope with rapid changes in water availability and land-use patterns, scarcity of labor due to declining population, variability and uncertainty related to changing weather and climate, and aging rural infrastructures. Arid lands and drylands, which cover much of the Western US, are expected to expand as the climate changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can bring a paradigm shift in how the twin economic and environmental challenges of farming and ranching in arid lands can be addressed. AI can support farmers to operate with greater efficiency and precision through the assistance of autonomous systems (e.g., drones, ground vehicles, and intelligent irrigation systems) and the support of intelligent software systems to aid in decision making (e.g., detecting and resolving crop diseases). AI-driven solutions will not only enable farmers to do more with less; they will also improve quality and ensure a faster path-to-market for crops and livestock. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to New Mexico State University (NMSU) will enable the creation of a coordinated graduate training program, called Artificial Intelligence for Arid Land Agriculture (AIALA), to prepare the next generation of scholars and practitioners by teaching graduate students how to bridge the divides between AI and Agriculture for Arid Lands. The project anticipates training 33 MS and Ph.D. students, including 18 funded trainees, from computing-related disciplines and agriculture-related disciplines . The AIALA scholar experience will integrate with and complement the traditional graduate disciplinary training, thus contextualizing the in-depth disciplinary research for researchers in either AI or agriculture-related areas. Moreover, the experience will allow scholars to effectively serve as catalysts in research teams using AI to solve arid land challenges. The research conducted by the AIALA scholars and their research mentors will advance the state of the art in both AI and Arid Land Agriculture. The research will promote the creation of novel multi-agent systems frameworks, advancing the state of the art in machine learning and distributed data analytics. In addition, it will provide methodologies and technologies to enhance the adaptability of crops, rangeland plants and livestock, improve the resiliency of livestock in expansive rugged rangelands, and ultimately lead to resilient and sustainable arid land agricultural systems. The AIALA training model benefits from a number of innovations. First, it establishes a transdisciplinary training pipeline, embedding AI research challenges in Arid Land Agricultural challenges, enabling contextualized and situated learning. Second, it integrates graduate students and faculty mentors in mutually supportive teams of learners, supported, in turn, by an extensive mentoring infrastructure. Third, it infuses diversity and inclusion in all operations and learning activities, promoting engagement of a diverse audience of scholars and preparing the scholars to serve as agents of change for inclusion. Finally, it emphasizes the development of professional skills as part of holistic disciplinary training. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This project is an ExpandAI Capacity building pilot (CAP), which focuses on establishing and growing AI related activities at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) by growing a pool of AI practitioners that will drive a sustainable expansion of AI-powered research and education. On the research side, interdisciplinary AI-driven projects will result in a vibrant South Texas community of AI practitioners that will significantly boost the impact of AI in areas such as agriculture, advanced manufacturing, and personalized medicine. On the educational side, new AI micro-credential courses and course enhancements will impart AI-related skills to large numbers of students, most of whom are from under-represented groups given the composition of the UTRGV student body. Significantly, two newly formed interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs will use AI-enhanced courses to train students in cutting-edge research techniques. Outreach to high schools and community colleges is planned. Five research areas have been identified as potential growth areas for AI technologies across campus including nanomaterials, advanced manufacturing, agriculture, cybersecurity and biomedicine. For example, in the agricultural domain, researchers will investigate Smart Farming AI tools - the use of affordable drones and video sensors to gather and analyze data for improved water utilization and soil fertility. In biomedicine, researchers will use clinical phenotype, genotype, and biomarker datasets to train AI models for improved disease modeling and personalized interventional strategies for diseases that disproportionately impact the Hispanic population of South Texas. Educational transformation is planned through two approaches: (i) creation of domain-specific micro-credential courses for delivery of skills needed to engage with AI tools; (ii) infusion of AI content into existing courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels through curriculum modification. Courses emphasize both practical skills in use of AI tools as well as the theoretical aspects of AI. The ExpandAI Program supports AI-powered education and workforce development, infrastructure and research at Minority Serving Institutions to strengthen and diversify U.S. research and education pathways and provide historically marginalized communities with new opportunities in STEM careers. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This award supports a participation of U.S. researchers in a multilateral conference organized by researchers in the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan (Quad) on the theme of Advancing Innovation to Empower Next Generation AGriculturE (AI-ENGAGE). The workshop aims to help scope the AI-ENGAGE theme with a focus on opportunities for joint research in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, sensing and/or communications with applications to agriculture, particularly applications that can positively impact resilience and yields. The workshop will also build a community of researchers from Quad countries collaborating at the intersection of emerging technologies and agriculture. As the global population is projected to swell to 9.7 billion by 2050, the challenges of ensuring adequate food production and sustainability of land and water resources are becoming increasingly complex and pressing. This burgeoning demographic trend poses a substantial strain on our agricultural systems, requiring a paradigm shift in how we approach food production and resource management. Historical precedents underscore the effectiveness of innovative, science-driven solutions in empowering farmers and transforming food production systems. However, the contemporary landscape presents challenges exacerbated by climate change, escalating pest pressures, and supply chain dynamics. These challenges are not confined within national borders but are deeply interconnected across regions, necessitating a collaborative, multi-national approach. The workshop is expected to consider topics such as artificial intelligence, automation, risk forecasting and management, robotics, sensing and/or and communications with applications to agriculture. By forming research networks that span Quad countries, teams can prototype and test approaches across geographies, share data, and leverage each otherâ€™s technical expertise for the common good. The workshop is an opportunity to catalyze those Quad research networks. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Mitigating the impact of global climate change on sustainable agriculture and, consequently food production depends on our ability to cultivate plants that tolerate increasing heat, drought, and extreme weather events while requiring fewer resources for growth. Advances in both fundamental and applied research have driven key innovations in plant science; however, fundamental discoveries in the lab rarely hold up under dynamic field conditions. Thus, they fall short of meeting the escalating demand for effective translatable solutions. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other data-driven approaches to the wealth of data generated by fundamental and applied plant scientists offers potential solutions to this problem. However, cross-domain data analytics remain underutilized due to historical disciplinary silos that limit student training. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to North Carolina State University will, in partnership with Fayetteville State University, train twenty-one (21) doctoral students, including ten (10) NSF-funded trainees, at the convergence of plant science and AI to accelerate the translation of knowledge from lab to field to market. The potential of AI and ML to facilitate translational plant science offers a fertile learning environment for transdisciplinary graduate training. Within this traineeship, collaborative graduate student cohort training approaches will be used, engaging diverse students from plant science, data and computer science, and engineering graduate programs. Cohorts will be challenged to complete user-inspired capstone research projects in partnership with local growers and cross-disciplinary faculty advisor teams over two years. These partnerships, facilitated by on-farm learning experiences, an interdisciplinary orientation boot camp, industry internships, and community outreach, will provide an immersive learning environment that enhances studentsâ€™ abilities to identify and tackle real world challenges at the intersection of basic and applied plant science and AI. A convergent curriculum will increase student proficiency and core competency in these areas, while also educating students on the societal implications, impacts, concerns, and risks associated with applying AI and ML to agriculture. Research, teaching, and academic partnerships with minority serving institutions will enable the future development of a new bridge to the doctorate training program that increases the presence of those underrepresented in plant sciences and engineering. To address the grand challenge of sustainable agriculture and global food security, this training program will create a diverse, interdisciplinary workforce empowered to engage with industry, grower, and academic partners. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program will bring together graduate students from multiple disciplines interested in design and engineering for sustainability to solve real-world problems and increase climate resilience. This project will offer students not only core technical education and training opportunities but important soft skills to become inclusive and responsible future workforce. It will foster collaborations and support immersive experiences for trainees and build a diverse community in STEAM fields. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. The United Nations predicts a global population beyond 9 billion by 2050, requiring at least doubling current food production. However, half of our planet's habitable land is already used for agriculture with little left for new farms. As such, food productivity must increase in order to grow more food within the land we have. Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) offers a great potential solution â€“ in this type of indoor farming, plants grow in oxygenated, fertilizer-rich hydroponics rather than soil, allowing growers to optimize plant nutrition. Paired with the precise control of environmental conditions enabled by indoor cultivation, plants can exhibit enhanced productivity in hydroponic systems and can be cultivated at higher areal densities in vertical configurations. Further, agricultural digitization can help improve efficiency, resilience, and sustainability of commercial vertical farming by opening the door to implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) for automation, real-time monitoring and control, and exploitation of massive amounts of data, promising deeper fundamental understanding of both plant physiology and performance within an engineering context. In this project, AI4OPT-AG, established by Georgia Tech, will lead an exploratory multi-national research network with targeted institutions in Japan, Australia, and India to collaborate and accelerate innovations in digital agriculture and optimization, and bolster food security for our future. High-fidelity digital-twin-based approaches to digitization, and further, in-silico optimization, remain nascent in agriculture and the life sciences more broadly. This cultivation modality presents a useful platform for the study of living, dynamic, cyber-physical systems, with the implementation of hydroponic rather than soil-based configurations enabling direct, near-instantaneous control of the plant growth environment. Two specific next-generation techniques, hyperspectral imaging and gas chromatography fingerprinting of plant signaling molecules, could unlock valuable fundamental insights into plant physiology, but generate massive datasets requiring efficient processing to generate actionable insights. Innovations in digital agriculture, particularly in the engineering and integration of artificial intelligence (AI), biofeedback, and robotics could accelerate both knowledge generation and technology development. The primary challenges associated with this approach arise from the massive quantity of data, and the heterogeneity in data modality, quality, resolution, frequency, and complexity. There is also an opportunity to hybridize modeling approaches beyond purely data-driven or first- principles- based approaches. Such a hybrid approach may improve capabilities beyond those of its individual components, with first principles based physiological models providing fundamental constraints, transparency, and a tether to ground truths, while data-driven approaches provide data augmentation, unparalleled fitting abilities, and efficient management of high dimensional data. We are developing novel approaches to manage, integrate, exploit, and optimize these disparate, and often sparse data streams to enable rapid, computationally efficient techniques to support control and optimization applications. Although robotics and automation are valuable paths towards rapid feedback and high-throughput data collection in vertical farming operations, innovations in AI are crucial to enable rapid, accurate, high-throughput, non-destructive plant status determinations as a platform for performance optimization. This award is supported as part of the Quad AI-ENGAGE initiative to advance innovation through critical technologies to empower next generation agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Globally, food systems are responsible for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions and over 85% of water consumption, fueling climate change and negative environmental impacts. In the US, approximately 30% of the food produced goes to waste, while over 10% of households experience some level of food insecurity, largely in underrepresented communities. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can revolutionize the US food and agriculture sector across the food value chain, â€œfrom farm to fork,â€ to meet the growing needs for environmental sustainability and climate resilience, while ensuring equitable access to healthy food for all Americans. Before AI tools and applications are deployed widely in the food and agricultural sector, it is critical to understand needs, concerns, and potential impacts on stakeholders in the sector. The proposed convenings will assemble experts in AI and food systems and stakeholders in the food and agriculture sector to discuss how AI technology should be designed, developed, and deployed in the sector and how the sectorâ€™s workforce can be trained to support the responsible and ethical use of AI across the food value chain. The convenings will emphasize AI that helps food systems address three societal challenges: environmental sustainability, climate resilience, and equitable access to healthy food. Convening objectives are to: 1) raise awareness and identify approaches and needs for AI to address societal challenges in food systems; 2) create education and workforce training recommendations to support responsible and ethical AI use in food systems; 3) convene stakeholders across the food value chain to build cross-sector teams to achieve objectives 1 and 2; and 4) identify potential model projects and agendas for involving stakeholders in AI design, development, and deployment in food systems to minimize harm across the technology life cycle. The convenings will include five online Communities of Practice in January -February 2025 and an in-person Workshop in May 2025, with facilitated discussions to generate recommendations and develop partnerships that build towards the conveningsâ€™ objectives. Participants will include experts in AI and food systems and stakeholders from across the food value chain. Output from the Communities of Practice and Workshop will be presented to the public in an online Symposium in September 2025 for a final round of feedback. Final products of the convenings will include a Responsible Design, Development, Deployment of Technology (ReDDDoT) model for AI in food systems that can inform NSFâ€™s ReDDDoT needs and priorities for other sectors and technologies. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Cornell University will develop an interdisciplinary graduate training and research program on AI for Sustainability Sciences and Engineering (AISSE), focusing on decarbonizing energy and agri-food systems. The project addresses the urgent need for innovative solutions to sustainability challenges, such as climate change, highlighted by the record-breaking global average temperature in July 2023. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, the NRT seeks to cultivate a skilled workforce proficient in both AI and sustainability, responding to the increasing demand in these rapidly evolving fields. The project anticipates training 105 PhD students, including 25 NRT Fellows, 30 Project-Focused Fellows, and 50 NRT Travel Grant Awardees, from 16 academic departments across Cornellâ€™s colleges of Engineering, Computing and Information Science, Agriculture, and Arts & Sciences. This interdisciplinary effort also partners with five minority-serving institutions and several Cornell research centers specializing in AI, sustainability, digital agriculture, and energy systems, aiming to equip trainees with the technical and professional skills to address scientific, societal, and workforce needs. The AISSE NRT program will develop advanced AI methodologies to create sustainable materials, decarbonize energy systems, enable climate-smart food production, and analyze the energy-food-climate nexus. These research efforts will tackle forefront scientific and societal challenges while advancing transformative AI methodologies. Key training elements of the NRT include a small-grant initiative, a rigorous practicum program, and an immersive bootcamp combining a crash course with a team-science workshop. The curriculum will feature harmonized courses, cross-field lab rotations, and joint mentorships to promote interdisciplinary research training. Additionally, the program emphasizes developing professional skills in scientific communication, team science, ethics, leadership, and entrepreneurship. Expected outcomes include creating new AI tools and methods, advancing sustainability science and engineering, and preparing graduates with interdisciplinary expertise and professional skills. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative education, the AISSE NRT aims to produce a workforce capable of using AI to tackle sustainability and decarbonization challenges, ensuring long-term impact. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Black diasporic farming communities are important sites of sustainable food production for millions of people in the US and worldwide. As tight-knit agricultural collectives, they generate food throughout cities, promote diasporic values of ecological well-being, resource conservation, and interdependence, and foster the possibility of social and political transformation for black, indigenous, racialized and marginalized groups. While advancements in food security, nutrition, and environmental health have the potential to feed nearly twice as many people per year, particularly among historically marginalized groups, black diasporic urban farming communities face several hurdles to efficiency that remain largely under-addressed. Activities such as risk management, soil health monitoring, and crop harvesting rely on repeated, time-consuming work that is challenging to support on limited budgets, resources, and labor. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) promises solutions to many of these challenges, making the case for an emerging market around AI-driven agricultural technologies. This project aims to (1) advance understanding of sociotechnical ecosystems involving AI to support diasporic urban farming; (2) collaboratively develop AI-based technologies that better integrates and sustains technological gains with diasporic knowledge, and (3) systematically assess the impact of AI-based farming technologies on diasporic communities and industrial partners. In particular, our research seeks to advance the field of smart agriculture for diasporic urban farming communities along three urgent axes: (1) Labor: Addressing labor needs, decreasing bias within weeding, and ensuring access to affordable services for farmers who need them; (2) Ecosystem: Advancing care for a farmâ€™s ecological conditions by supporting synergistic relationships with the land and surrounding organisms, training novice farmers, and monitoring greenhouse conditions; (3) Health: Innovating mechanisms for healthy soil conditions, reducing toxicity, and increasing the quality and quantity of nutrients. This work unfolds across three phases. Phase 1 begins with an ethnographic case study involving participant observation of urban agricultural practices and semi-structured interviews with partner organizations and identified stakeholders. Phase 2 complements this empirical work with an evaluation and design study that identifies sociotechnical solutions for agricultural decision-making informed by black diasporic needs. Phase 3 involves technical implementation that mindfully integrates black diasporic knowledge with AI-based technologies towards a smart and connected diasporic farming infrastructure. This work relies on our interdisciplinary teamâ€™s close collaboration with three farming organizations, three industry partners, and sustained partnerships across wider diasporic farming networks, and oversight from experts in AI, HCI, critical geography, urban studies, and community-based inquiry. This project is partially funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which is committed to funding research and practice with continued focus on investigating a range of informal STEM learning (ISL) experiences and environments that make lifelong learning a reality. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. The project aims to develop models for analyzing artificial intelligence (AI) robotsâ€™ (AI agents) motivations and behaviors and to understand their diverse relationships as they cooperate and adapt to the needs and behaviors of humans and other AI agents. The projectâ€™s novelty is its focus on modeling cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) from the cognitive science perspective and investigating how they reach consensus and integrate human needs through a shared needs-oriented trust network in the interaction. The projectâ€™s impacts are in advancing artificial social systems (like multi-robot systems and self-driving cars) in human society and to help them to work harmoniously with us, supporting sustainable human development. Moreover, the success of this project could enable cognitive modeling for cooperability-aware MAS of advanced AI architectures and software, leading to new technologies and applications in the computing, communications, electronics, aerospace, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries. The lead research investigator is engaging in outreach activities involving teachers and K-12 students through hands-on exposure to advanced AI and robotics technologies. The projectâ€™s three main objectives are to (1) design self-regulating AI agents with self-goal setting, self-monitoring, self-instruction, and self-reinforcement learning abilities, (2) design multi-sensor AI agents and corresponding communication protocols that will allow the robots to quantify their needs, recognize their innate values, and reach a consensus through negotiation, and (3) build an interface to share human needs with robots in real-time, guaranteeing human and AI agents interact in the same needs-oriented trust network. Finally, the project combines the characteristics of three models into a single system and analyzes how robots interact within a multi-robot testbed. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This project is an ExpandAI Capacity building pilot (CAP), which focuses on establishing and growing AI related activities at Texas State University - San Marcos. This project aims to significantly expand access to AI education, infrastructure, and research opportunities through widespread integration of AI technology into non-AI disciplines such as criminal justice, psychology, firefighting and agriculture. By leveraging the collective expertise and resources of the team, the project will promote interdisciplinary research and education to grow a diverse pool of AI practitioners that will drive sustainable expansion of AI technology across the Texas State University San Marcos campus and in the nearby community. Led by a diverse team of researchers from various academic departments, the project will catalyze institutional change at Texas State University San Marcos by providing comprehensive training to underrepresented individuals, empowering them to pursue AI-related careers thereby enriching the field with diverse perspectives. The proposal describes a four-pronged approach to AI-related institutional transformation at Texas State University San Marcos: (i) enhancing instructional and curricular capacity by developing innovative models for teaching and learning using AI; (ii) improving the efficiency of AI research by providing high-performance computing training that will speed up data pre-processing and neural network training; (iii) investing in foundational and use-inspired AI research and (iv) workforce development initiatives for individuals traditionally underserved in AI. Curriculum development initiatives include the establishment of an Applied AI Summer School and the development of several new AI-related course modules in areas such as Data Analytics, Python programming, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Evidence-based pedagogical approaches - such as inclusive pedagogy, reflective practices and contextualization â€“ will be employed to support student learning. In collaboration with the Texas State University San Marcos Center for Analytics and Data Science, this project will establish an inclusive AI ecosystem and promote interdisciplinary collaboration, driving groundbreaking research in use-inspired AI. The ExpandAI Program supports AI-powered education and workforce development, infrastructure and research at Minority Serving Institutions to strengthen and diversify U.S. research and education pathways and provide historically marginalized communities with new opportunities in STEM careers. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. The Rural AI Solutions and Engagement (RAISE) project is a collaboration between the University of Alaska Anchorage, Salisbury University, and Valdosta State University to build sustainable and strategic partnerships centered around Artificial Intelligence (AI) with industry, non-profit, indigenous, and government stakeholders in their respective regions. Each university serves a rural area in Alaska, Maryland, and Georgia, respectively. Rural communities face challenges such as limited technological infrastructure, educational resources, and access to rapidly evolving technology such as AI. This project addresses these challenges by building capacity at each institution to collaborate and partner with the community, strengthen research capabilities, and ultimately develop innovative AI solutions to rural problems. The broad goals shared by the collaborating institutions are to develop capacity in (a) building partnerships, (b) research administration, (c) research development, and (d) research leadership. Utilizing these capacities, each institution will utilize AI to advance practical solutions in fields such as agriculture, energy, and education that are central to addressing community and rural needs in their region.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. A crop's traits and 3D structure (the shape and architecture of plants, including both above- and below-ground parts) are the attributes that chiefly influence crop growth and yield and provide critical evidence for plant phenotyping (the characterization assessment of plant traits). Crop yield predictions can be made by assessing 3D plant structures using crop sensing methods. However, crop sensing results at different scales are usually analyzed in isolation, which overlooks essential connections. Moreover, while root systems play a central role in plant functions, current methods mainly assess crops based on above-ground crop structure due to the difficulty of accessing roots. Current methods use satellites for remote sensing and drones for local sensing, enabling crop assessment at varying scales; however, it is difficult to integrate these observations effectively, and the information stream is formidable. The overarching objective of this project is to develop a novel AI infrastructure to integrate these observations to model and assess 3D crop structures at multiple scales and enhance below-ground sensing capabilities. Using this infrastructure, 3D crop structures can be estimated accurately at the individual, farm, and satellite scales, facilitating crop assessment and yield prediction. The project dramatically enhances and accelerates the ability of growers and agronomists to assess critical crop field structural variation for both above- and below-ground components, enabling large-scale crop management. This project also benefits students, from the high school to the Ph.D. level, by applying multi-scale 3D models of above- and below-ground crop structures to immersive education methods (Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and online learning), which are well-suited to solving the challenges of distance learning, especially for subjects like agriculture requiring field study. The multi-scale sensing system is also capable of estimating 3D landscape structures and large-scale crop structures and can be utilized in other areas, such as Arctic Sea ice modeling, forestry, and climate change studies. This project aims to connect a plantâ€™s structural phenotypes below- and above- ground and link in-situ measurements to satellite sensing data, thus enabling non-destructive crop root sensing and root-system status estimation based on observation of plant growth above-ground while at the same time empowering satellite images to assess these factors to furnish more local and detailed information. This project establishes a method for 3D crop sensing of individual plants, crop fields, and satellite regions to provide multi-scale crop structural evidence for crop assessment and yield prediction. This project also develops a novel AI neural network to sense root structures and predict traits based on sensing above-ground plant structures. This project investigates methods for satellite-based 3D sensing and nondestructive below-ground root sensing. Novel AI infrastructures are explored to address critical issues in computer vision and remote sensing, efficient integration of multi-scale sensing, 3D structure prediction, and spatial-temporal 4D inference. Such an approach can lower the ceiling for operational adoption of satellite and in-situ imagery assessments, based on a scientifically underpinned, multi-scale, 3D assessment workflow. In addition to its essential and practical implications for agriculture professionals, this project also explores novel AI solutions within computer vision and remote sensing. Crop structures are highly diverse, complicated, and changing phenomena. Therefore, agriculture presents an ideal research domain for investigating novel AI methods. This research advances AI by 1) largely improving the fusion effectiveness of various remote sensing modalities from sensors mounted on different devices, 2) significantly enhancing the learning capability by connecting sensing outputs expressed in multiple scales, 3) enabling 3D structure prediction for objects across different domains, and 4) providing future status prediction based on 4D spatial-temporal neural networks. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have entered the â€œmulti-tenantâ€ era, where multiple deep neural network (DNN) models are executed simultaneously. This involves concurrent deployment, computation, and interaction of multiple DNN models, increasing computational complexity and triggering new challenges: (1) How can a scalable and flexible computing architecture be realized that can adaptively host heterogeneous and concurrent DNN models? (2) How can computing flexibility requirements in multi-tenant DNN scenarios be met? (3) How can an efficient, end-to-end toolchain for building next-generation AI applications be realized in this context? This project addresses these challenges through three research thrusts: Thrust 1 investigates a novel processing-in-memory (PIM)-assisted graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture with innovative multi-tenant support, addressing important resource contention and model interaction issues. Thrust 2 explores dedicated GPU- and PIM-oriented scheduling techniques to enhance the platformâ€™s performance. Finally, thrust 3 further enhances the multi-tenant AI application development cycle with algorithm optimization and code deployment support. With the successful completion of these thrusts, this project can achieve breakthroughs in modern AI computing and support the next generation of AI applications. The proposed techniques have the potential to accelerate AI design and deployment, spurring even wider AI utilization. This can contribute to important application areas with societal importance, including autonomous driving, metaverse immersion, smart agriculture, and industrial infrastructure. This project will also benefit students --and by consequence, society-- by incorporating research results within relevant courses, increasing the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in computing, and sharing research results with researchers, companies, and government agencies.

Although the world is witness to the tremendous successes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in some domains, many domains have yet to reap the benefits of AI due to the lack of easily usable AI infrastructure. The NSF AI Institute for Intelligent Cyberinfrastructure with Computational Learning in the Environment (ICICLE) will develop intelligent cyberinfrastructure with transparent and high-performance execution on diverse and heterogeneous environments. It will advance plug-and-play AI that is easy to use by scientists across a wide range of domains, promoting the democratization of AI. ICICLE brings together a multidisciplinary team of scientists and engineers, led by The Ohio State University in partnership with Case Western Reserve University, IC-FOODS, Indiana University, Iowa State University, Ohio Supercomputer Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, San Diego Supercomputer Center, Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Utah, University of California-Davis, University of California-San Diego, University of Delaware, and University of Wisconsin-Madison. Initially, complex societal challenges in three use-inspired scientific domains will drive ICICLEâ€™s research and workforce development agenda: Smart Foodsheds, Precision Agriculture, and Animal Ecology. ICICLEâ€™s research and development includes: (i) Empowering plug-and-play AI by advancing five foundational areas: knowledge graphs, model commons, adaptive AI, federated learning, and conversational AI. (ii) Providing a robust cyberinfrastructure capable of propelling AI-driven science (CI4AI), solving the challenges arising from heterogeneity in applications, software, and hardware, and disseminating the CI4AI innovations to use-inspired science domains. (iii) Creating new AI techniques for the adaptation/optimization of various CI components (AI4CI), enabling a virtuous cycle to advance both AI and CI. (iv) Developing novel techniques to address cross-cutting issues including privacy, accountability, and data integrity for CI and AI; and (v) Providing a geographically distributed and heterogeneous system consisting of software, data, and applications, orchestrated by a common application programming interface and execution middleware. ICICLEâ€™s advanced and integrated edge, cloud, and high-performance computing hardware and software CI components simplify the use of AI, making it easier to address new areas of inquiry. In this way, ICICLE focuses on research in AI, innovation through AI, and accelerates the application of AI. ICICLE is building a diverse STEM workforce through innovative approaches to education, training, and broadening participation in computing that ensure sustained measurable outcomes and impact on a national scale, along the pipeline from middle/high school students to practitioners. As a nexus of collaboration, ICICLE promotes technology transfer to industry and other stakeholders, as well as data sharing and coordination across other National Science Foundation AI Institutes and Federal agencies. As a national resource for research, development, technology transfer, workforce development, and education, ICICLE is creating a widely usable, smarter, more robust and diverse, resilient, and effective CI4AI and AI4CI ecosystem.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Communications and sensing have traditionally operated independently, utilizing separate frequency bands and hardware. The integration of these technologies, known as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), aims to enhance spectral, energy, and cost efficiency. ISAC designs find applications in wireless communications, localization, autonomous vehicles, area imaging, environmental monitoring, and more. However, achieving optimal ISAC designs solely through analytical approaches faces challenges due to performance trade-offs and complexity. To overcome these hurdles, this project employs artificial intelligence (AI) to design such solutions and establish theoretical foundations for ISAC. A unique European collaboration (Finland) unites diverse research expertise, fostering economic, societal, and research impacts. Knowledge transfer occurs through dissemination, curriculum development, student exchanges, and industry collaborations. The project also engages with farmers' markets to showcase ISAC's potential to benefit local agriculture. This project aims to explore the optimal integration of sensing and communications through AI-assisted ISAC designs. The research consists of three interconnected thrusts. The first thrust involves designing unified waveforms, constellations, and beamforming techniques for both sensing and communications. Additionally, AI-based channel learning and generation methods will be developed. The second thrust focuses on implementing ISAC designs using large aperture arrays. The project aims to establish the theoretical foundations of the extended near-field of ISAC channels with electrically large aperture arrays and leverage the unique channel characteristics to optimize integration gains. The third thrust is dedicated to real-time implementation and evaluation of the AI-assisted ISAC designs and algorithms, considering factors such as performance, robustness, and advancement metrics.

Internet of Things (IoT) is anticipated to comprise approximately 75+ billion interconnected devices by 2025. Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled IoT devices consist of sensory imaging systems that enable data collection from people and the environment. However, insufficient computing ability of small IoT devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, etc., and memory/compute-intensive AI tasks prevent AI techniques from being widely deployed in such devices. This proposal enables a smooth transition from the state-of-the-art cloud-centric IoT approach to a data-centric approach, enabling mobile edge devices to perform computation close to the sensor by repurposing the cache memory to a data-parallel processing unit. This will remarkably reduce the power consumption and latency of data transmission to the cloud. Moreover, this project seeks to design and deploy new hardware-oriented AI algorithms into edge devices for efficient image processing, reducing the computation complexity and memory access, while maintaining accuracy. With the technologies developed in this project, more powerful and stable IoT devices can be introduced ensuring accelerated operation with applications of societal importance spanning healthcare monitoring, automotive applications, industrial and agriculture sensing, intelligent infrastructure, etc. A comprehensive circuit-to-system assessment framework will be adopted to systematically evaluate the performance of the system on several IoT workload suites. This project will make a strong effort on developing undergraduate and graduate course modules, propagating transportable and open-source models, and broadening STEM participation through publications/presentations at conferences and workshops and involving undergraduate minority students. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to synthesize an intelligent polymer hydrogel, and to develop a wireless, remote and sensitive magnetoelastic sensor for rapid detection of avian influenza (AI) virus. The highly pathogenic AI strain H5N1 virus has caused hundreds of human deaths and billion dollars of economic loss per year. High sensitive techniques for early identification and eradication of AI viruses are urgently needed. The proposed smart material is expected to shrink and swell in the absence and presence of AI virus due to the crosslinking between single stranded DNA and aptamers and dissolution of the linkage in the polymer network. The shrinking and swelling of the hydrogel upon AI virus could be sensitively monitored with a wireless magnetoelastic mass-based sensor platform. The broader impacts of this research are on the development of new biosensing materials for rapid diagnostics in the fields of biology, agriculture, medicine and environment. It will open a new way to synthesize virus-responsive materials by introducing ssDNA and aptamers into polymer structures. Moreover, the proposed project is to improve influenza diagnostic technologies and to prevent avian influenza from spread between flocks or into the human population. The successful outcome of this research should provide direct economic benefits to poultry and food industries, promote diagnostic technologies, and improve human health. This proposed method has the potential to provide a rapid, low-cost, high sensitive and reliable solution for identification and detection of avian influenza as well as human and swine influenza. A sustainable energy supply is a critical driver for our nationâ€™s continued industrial and economic growth. Therefore, it is necessary to make current and future energy infrastructures more responsive and resilient. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award, led by North Dakota State University with collaborators: University of Arkansas - Fayetteville, University of Nevada - Las Vegas, and Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, aims to enhance technological progress and economic growth of the jurisdiction states and the nation, while creating a new generation of workforce ready for the era of AI. The unique challenges faced by the jurisdiction states, including dispersed populations, extreme weather conditions, weak positions in energy networks and/or agriculture-based economies, motivate the team to explore an AI-based framework capable of identifying the vulnerable elements in the energy and related infrastructure networks, quantifying the health of the energy infrastructure, and providing automated resilience strategies against the impacts of catastrophic failures for a secured energy supply. This project will overcome critical regional and national issues related to vulnerable energy systems by creating holistic solutions against the negative impacts of energy disruptions on complex interdependent infrastructure networks via the exploration of innovative AI, engineering, economics, and operations research methodologies. The interdisciplinary team, consisting of experts in industrial engineering, civil and environmental engineering, computer science (especially AI), electrical engineering (especially power systems), public policy and economics, will explore the related methodologies that will be widely disseminated and implemented in a broad cross-section of industries where AI can contribute. The collaborative effort will promote AI as an industry of the future and generate immediate tangible impacts on industries in desperate need of an AI-proficient workforce by offering an AI-related associate degree and minor programs. The team will also support early career faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, especially Native American and Hispanic participants from tribal and minority serving institutions. The intellectual merit goal of the Artificial Intelligence on Sustainable Energy Infrastructure Network (AI SUSTEIN) is to establish a collaborative research program to investigate the potential of AI as a driving force for bringing about radical changes to critical infrastructures and industries. AI SUSTEIN will conduct the following research activities: (1) understand and quantify the interdependency in infrastructure networks and perform risk and economic impact assessment on both the industrial and economic aspects using AI; (2) develop a decentralized AI-based health monitoring and failure prediction system of energy infrastructure using real-time data; and (3) create a strategic framework for improving the resilience of energy infrastructure and local industries via AI-enhanced maintenance planning, optimization, and decision-making. The broader impact goals of AI SUSTEIN are to 1) serve as a vital source of information and resources; 2) partner with all the stakeholders especially industries to ultimately form a research center in AI and data analytics, and 3) develop diverse workforce and empower them with necessary AI skills. AI SUSTEIN will engage in the following workforce development/educational efforts: (1) develop an interdisciplinary team-taught course on AI and data analytics in critical infrastructure and provide research training to students from tribal and minority serving institutions; (2) mentor and support junior faculty; (3) create and offer a technical assistance program for infrastructure industry on AI and big data approaches for real-time condition monitoring, maintenance planning, and reliability issues and partner with the industries to secure their commitment and support for establishing an NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center; and (4) facilitate and coordinate the formation of an associate degree program on AI at a tribal college and offer an AI minor at the participating universities. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This project addresses a general class of machine learning problems involving loosely-coupled heterogeneous domains. Such problems have significant applications in various fields, from precision agriculture (plant genotype-to-phenotype) to precision medicine (genotype-disease associations) to ecology (soil moisture-climate interactions). Beyond the specific challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, an equally important and related challenge is diversifying the talent pool with the technical capability to these problems. The project has three specific goals: (1) develop methods for association pattern discovery in loosely-coupled domains; (2) perform information integration, prototype development, and evaluation of the methods developed; (3) capacity building in research and education in machine learning/artificial intelligence and their applications in precision agriculture at West Virginia State University (WVSU). The project includes two case studies. The first is on the genotype-to-phenotype problem in precision agriculture, specifically on fruit phenotypes in habanero pepper, an important fruit crop. The second will apply proposed learning models to the problem of mapping fruit phenotype to sensory perception, which is needed to predict taste and flavor in fruit crops. The project also involves capacity building efforts to improve research capability for faculty at WVSU, while providing research training for students. Educational activities include curriculum development in data literacy and research training in machine learning and data analytics for undergraduate and graduate students. Further, the project will educate faculty, students, and the public within the local region on innovations and trends in artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications. The project includes deliberate plans to involve minority students and faculty from WVSU, an HBCU (Historically Black College and University) with collaborators at West Virginia University (WVU), an R1 institution. By so doing, the project will improve data science literacy across the entire university at WVSU and to develop more of the studentsâ€™ skills in data-driven analysis. Identifying reliable patterns of association between seemingly disparate domains remains a core challenge at the foundation of data science and machine learning. Doing this when the domains involved are each complex, heterogeneous, and have enormous datasets is an even more arduous task. The project identifies a class of problems involving loosely-coupled heterogeneous domains, and propose an innovative framework for performing large-scale association discoveries across such complex domains. Our framework is built on a strong theoretical foundation, namely, the information bottleneck rooted in information theory. The project makes new theoretical contributions to the foundation of data science and machine learning by developing new methods for learning hidden associations across two heterogeneous domains, and for integrating information across such domains. The project also develops novel applications of the new learning methods to two specific problems in precision agriculture and crop phenomics. The proposed method of discovering association patterns under the identified class of loosely-couple domains can easily be modified for any member of this identified class. This class is quite general, and includes problems in various fields of human endeavor, from agriculture to precision medicine to ecology.

This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) grant supports research that contributes new knowledge in manufacturing process planning automation and promotes the progress of fundamental science in the fields of advanced manufacturing, computer science, mathematical modeling, and geometric reasoning. Hybrid manufacturing integrates different manufacturing processes in one system, enabling the creation of a ready-to-use functional part directly from raw or stock material. Hybridizing two advanced manufacturing processes, additive and subtractive manufacturing, potentially unleashes nearly full manufacturing capability by providing the freedom of adding and removing material in three-dimensional space. This permits the realization of part designs of complex shapes and functionality for a variety of applications. However, this extraordinary manufacturing capability also introduces unprecedented challenges in toolpath planning and motion control, impeding the broader application of hybrid manufacturing. This award supports fundamental research to explore and develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to facilitate smarter and better computer aided manufacturing (CAM) tools for hybrid manufacturing processes. The project advances the understanding of automated manufacturing toolpath planning and control and enables goal-oriented autonomous fabrication of parts of any geometry. This research advances digital manufacturing, enhances sustainability, and trains the future skilled workforce, which benefits the U.S. economy and society. The project benefits several industries such as aerospace, defense, healthcare, energy, agriculture, and others. This research lays out a new fully automated computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) framework for advanced High-Degree-of-Freedom (i.e., 5 or more axes operation) hybrid manufacturing processes. This framework leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for computer-aided design (CAD) geometry analysis and CAM toolpath planning and control. A generalized model for various manufacturing processes and the AI approach that provides the best solution is the thrust of this research. The data format of the model allows inherent support for AI methodology. New AI algorithms that are built on neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and reinforcement learning are investigated for automated toolpath planning. This work advances the knowledge base in advanced manufacturing by filling the knowledge gap on how human knowledge and production data can be harnessed and extended to realize new manufacturing capabilities. The research team plans to hybridize a 5-axis milling subtractive process and a 5-axis material extrusion/directed energy deposition type additive manufacturing process, explore the AI-CAM frameworkâ€™s capability to expand from one to two and then to multiple processes, and establish a standard training and testing methodology for AI-CAM for further expansion and generalization of the framework.

    Designing and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) tools in agriculture represents an exciting opportunity for international collaboration, uniting diverse expertise and resources to tackle global challenges. Our project aims to impact agriculture by developing, deploying, and democratizing AI tools to help farmers manage pests and stressors more effectively, making farming less risky, more profitable, and more sustainable. We plan to create AI-driven tools that provide personalized management advice, enhance crop yields, and support sustainable farming practices. This initiative will bring together scientists and practitioners from the US, India, and Japan, fostering international collaboration and innovation. The AI-driven approaches will benefit small and medium-sized farmers, offering easy-to-use, accessible technology to help them pursue climate-smart agriculture. The project also includes educational components and multilateral engagements to inspire the next generation of agricultural and AI experts. This EAGER project seeks to pursue multilateral research partnerships between the US, India, and Japan to develop and deploy AI-driven tools to enhance agricultural productivity. This team will work across two areas of collaborative effort: (i) developing hybrid machine learning models that combine sensor (proximal and remote) data with biophysical knowledge for yield and stress prediction, and (ii) utilizing agronomic data -- both biotic (insects, weeds, diseases) and abiotic (nutrient deficiencies, herbicide injury) -- to fine-tune and deploy large vision and language models developed by AIIRA (one of the five NIFA-funded National AI Institutes) in the US, led by Iowa State University (ISU). By collaborating with international partners that span diverse environments, we aim to develop and validate a robust, scalable framework for agricultural management that supports real-time decision-making and fosters sustainable agricultural practices globally. The initiative also emphasizes educational outreach, promoting interdisciplinary learning and broadening participation in AI-driven agriculture. This project is funded as part of the Quad AI-ENGAGE initiative, a collaboration of the National Science Foundation, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and Japan Science and Technology Agency to advance innovation to empower next generation agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Agriculture faces increasing challenges all around the world in the face of climate-change related issues. A new focus on climate smart agriculture catalyzed by developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence will be needed to better manage complex agricultural cyber-physical systems to maintain productivity to ensure food security while constraining the impact that agriculture has on greenhouse gas emissions. This proposal is to provide support for U.S. participation in a workshop on Internet of things (IoT)/artificial intelligence(AI)/machine learning (ML)-enabled precision agriculture to be hosted by Ben-Gurion University at Beer-Sheva in July 2023. The focus will be on big data acquisition and AI/ML-based analytics in precision agriculture. It will cover a wide range of topics focused on scoping of the key challenges remaining in how to use IoT/AI/ML to support further development of sustainable agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Sustained intensification in agricultural production to meet the caloric needs of a rapidly increasing population, and to do so while combating the impacts of climate change â€“ are two major grand challenges in 21st century agriculture. This project creates a three-way collaboration between the AgAID Institute (one of the five NIFA-funded AI Institutes) in the US led by Washington State University (WSU), the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and IIT-B Technology Innovation Hub (TIH) in India, and the University of Tokyo in Japan â€“ with a vision to include Australian research networks in the longer term. We will develop collaborative research plan using AI/ML methods and frameworks to improve agricultural and climate resilience in Indian agriculture. The proposed project will target two major scientific goals: 1) Build and test new AI-enabled infrastructure for in-field crop monitoring and phenotyping, with a focus on technology transfer across agricultural testbeds. 2) Develop and integrate AI-enabled soil water balance models for improved climate resilience and optimized water resource management in farms, to improve reliable estimation of soil moisture and other related soil-water balance measures at the farm scale. Crop monitoring and phenotyping are key technologies in precision agriculture that play a critical role for both on-farm, real-time decision support as well as in the development of new crop varieties optimized for important traits (e.g., yield, drought resistance, disease resistance). Furthermore, developing new predictive capabilities for key variables associated with soil and water is also vital for robust agricultural decision support. This project will investigate ways to test the transfer of AI-driven sensing technologies and edge-to-cloud workflows for potential deployment in rural Indian agriculture conditions. Toward predictive AI capabilities, this project will investigate the development of data-driven models for efficient water resource management, at a regional and farm scale. Innovations are expected for both the technology side â€“ development of scalable and affordable farm IoT technologies â€“ and the use-inspired AI side â€“ new data-driven machine learning models that couple scientific models with observable data toward robust real-time and site-specific decision support. The choice of problems and the proposed approach through AI have global scope and relevance to extend to other similar semi-arid geographies. This project is funded as part of the Quad AI-ENGAGE initiative, a collaboration of the National Science Foundation, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and Japan Science and Technology Agency to advance innovation to empower next generation agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology HBCU Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (CREST HBCU-RISE), this project aims to improve the theoretical Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure at Tennessee State University (TSU) for addressing important data science challenges. While AI applications have proliferated, there remains a gap in the fundamental mathematical theories required to construct reliable and secure AI systems suitable for safety-critical applications. This project seeks to address this. The expected outcomes include the advancement of scientific knowledge in AI theory and its practical applications in cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and agriculture. Additionally, this project aims to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration, promote broader participation in STEM fields, and strengthen research competitiveness at TSU. The overarching goal is to advance research capabilities in emerging AI areas and develop a comprehensive approach to educate and train Ph.D. students in collaboration with three TSU colleges: Engineering, Life and Physical Sciences, and Agriculture. The research will develop mathematical theory and practical algorithms for accurate and robust machine learning that can be applied for advancing research in privacy-preserving AI, protein structure modeling with enhanced cryo-electron microscopy imaging, and optimal feature selection for precision agriculture. High-dimensional manifold geometries for neural networks training, network linearization for homomorphic encryption in private AI, systematic integration of subspace segmentation and machine learning for cryo-electron microscopy, and quality assessment of multi-scale sensing data for crop parameters and yield estimation will be investigated. This project implements a coherent curriculum across three colleges for AI education, which includes developing educational materials, organizing professional development activities for students, providing Ph.D. student mentoring, and procuring research equipment to support this research. The CREST HBCU-RISE program supports the expansion of institutional research capacity as well as the successful training of doctoral students in STEM at HBCUs. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Global food supply and food security are at risk due to an increasing world population, climate change, diminishing natural resources, and limited available land. In agriculture, the primary challenge has been how to be more productive with less - less arable land, less water, less labor, less certainty. In arid lands, these challenges are amplified. Agricultural systems struggle to cope with rapid changes in water availability and land-use patterns, scarcity of labor due to declining population, variability and uncertainty related to changing weather and climate, and aging rural infrastructures. Arid lands and drylands, which cover much of the Western US, are expected to expand as the climate changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can bring a paradigm shift in how the twin economic and environmental challenges of farming and ranching in arid lands can be addressed. AI can support farmers to operate with greater efficiency and precision through the assistance of autonomous systems (e.g., drones, ground vehicles, and intelligent irrigation systems) and the support of intelligent software systems to aid in decision making (e.g., detecting and resolving crop diseases). AI-driven solutions will not only enable farmers to do more with less; they will also improve quality and ensure a faster path-to-market for crops and livestock. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to New Mexico State University (NMSU) will enable the creation of a coordinated graduate training program, called Artificial Intelligence for Arid Land Agriculture (AIALA), to prepare the next generation of scholars and practitioners by teaching graduate students how to bridge the divides between AI and Agriculture for Arid Lands. The project anticipates training 33 MS and Ph.D. students, including 18 funded trainees, from computing-related disciplines and agriculture-related disciplines . The AIALA scholar experience will integrate with and complement the traditional graduate disciplinary training, thus contextualizing the in-depth disciplinary research for researchers in either AI or agriculture-related areas. Moreover, the experience will allow scholars to effectively serve as catalysts in research teams using AI to solve arid land challenges. The research conducted by the AIALA scholars and their research mentors will advance the state of the art in both AI and Arid Land Agriculture. The research will promote the creation of novel multi-agent systems frameworks, advancing the state of the art in machine learning and distributed data analytics. In addition, it will provide methodologies and technologies to enhance the adaptability of crops, rangeland plants and livestock, improve the resiliency of livestock in expansive rugged rangelands, and ultimately lead to resilient and sustainable arid land agricultural systems. The AIALA training model benefits from a number of innovations. First, it establishes a transdisciplinary training pipeline, embedding AI research challenges in Arid Land Agricultural challenges, enabling contextualized and situated learning. Second, it integrates graduate students and faculty mentors in mutually supportive teams of learners, supported, in turn, by an extensive mentoring infrastructure. Third, it infuses diversity and inclusion in all operations and learning activities, promoting engagement of a diverse audience of scholars and preparing the scholars to serve as agents of change for inclusion. Finally, it emphasizes the development of professional skills as part of holistic disciplinary training. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This project is an ExpandAI Capacity building pilot (CAP), which focuses on establishing and growing AI related activities at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) by growing a pool of AI practitioners that will drive a sustainable expansion of AI-powered research and education. On the research side, interdisciplinary AI-driven projects will result in a vibrant South Texas community of AI practitioners that will significantly boost the impact of AI in areas such as agriculture, advanced manufacturing, and personalized medicine. On the educational side, new AI micro-credential courses and course enhancements will impart AI-related skills to large numbers of students, most of whom are from under-represented groups given the composition of the UTRGV student body. Significantly, two newly formed interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs will use AI-enhanced courses to train students in cutting-edge research techniques. Outreach to high schools and community colleges is planned. Five research areas have been identified as potential growth areas for AI technologies across campus including nanomaterials, advanced manufacturing, agriculture, cybersecurity and biomedicine. For example, in the agricultural domain, researchers will investigate Smart Farming AI tools - the use of affordable drones and video sensors to gather and analyze data for improved water utilization and soil fertility. In biomedicine, researchers will use clinical phenotype, genotype, and biomarker datasets to train AI models for improved disease modeling and personalized interventional strategies for diseases that disproportionately impact the Hispanic population of South Texas. Educational transformation is planned through two approaches: (i) creation of domain-specific micro-credential courses for delivery of skills needed to engage with AI tools; (ii) infusion of AI content into existing courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels through curriculum modification. Courses emphasize both practical skills in use of AI tools as well as the theoretical aspects of AI. The ExpandAI Program supports AI-powered education and workforce development, infrastructure and research at Minority Serving Institutions to strengthen and diversify U.S. research and education pathways and provide historically marginalized communities with new opportunities in STEM careers. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This award supports a participation of U.S. researchers in a multilateral conference organized by researchers in the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan (Quad) on the theme of Advancing Innovation to Empower Next Generation AGriculturE (AI-ENGAGE). The workshop aims to help scope the AI-ENGAGE theme with a focus on opportunities for joint research in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, sensing and/or communications with applications to agriculture, particularly applications that can positively impact resilience and yields. The workshop will also build a community of researchers from Quad countries collaborating at the intersection of emerging technologies and agriculture. As the global population is projected to swell to 9.7 billion by 2050, the challenges of ensuring adequate food production and sustainability of land and water resources are becoming increasingly complex and pressing. This burgeoning demographic trend poses a substantial strain on our agricultural systems, requiring a paradigm shift in how we approach food production and resource management. Historical precedents underscore the effectiveness of innovative, science-driven solutions in empowering farmers and transforming food production systems. However, the contemporary landscape presents challenges exacerbated by climate change, escalating pest pressures, and supply chain dynamics. These challenges are not confined within national borders but are deeply interconnected across regions, necessitating a collaborative, multi-national approach. The workshop is expected to consider topics such as artificial intelligence, automation, risk forecasting and management, robotics, sensing and/or and communications with applications to agriculture. By forming research networks that span Quad countries, teams can prototype and test approaches across geographies, share data, and leverage each otherâ€™s technical expertise for the common good. The workshop is an opportunity to catalyze those Quad research networks. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Mitigating the impact of global climate change on sustainable agriculture and, consequently food production depends on our ability to cultivate plants that tolerate increasing heat, drought, and extreme weather events while requiring fewer resources for growth. Advances in both fundamental and applied research have driven key innovations in plant science; however, fundamental discoveries in the lab rarely hold up under dynamic field conditions. Thus, they fall short of meeting the escalating demand for effective translatable solutions. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other data-driven approaches to the wealth of data generated by fundamental and applied plant scientists offers potential solutions to this problem. However, cross-domain data analytics remain underutilized due to historical disciplinary silos that limit student training. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to North Carolina State University will, in partnership with Fayetteville State University, train twenty-one (21) doctoral students, including ten (10) NSF-funded trainees, at the convergence of plant science and AI to accelerate the translation of knowledge from lab to field to market. The potential of AI and ML to facilitate translational plant science offers a fertile learning environment for transdisciplinary graduate training. Within this traineeship, collaborative graduate student cohort training approaches will be used, engaging diverse students from plant science, data and computer science, and engineering graduate programs. Cohorts will be challenged to complete user-inspired capstone research projects in partnership with local growers and cross-disciplinary faculty advisor teams over two years. These partnerships, facilitated by on-farm learning experiences, an interdisciplinary orientation boot camp, industry internships, and community outreach, will provide an immersive learning environment that enhances studentsâ€™ abilities to identify and tackle real world challenges at the intersection of basic and applied plant science and AI. A convergent curriculum will increase student proficiency and core competency in these areas, while also educating students on the societal implications, impacts, concerns, and risks associated with applying AI and ML to agriculture. Research, teaching, and academic partnerships with minority serving institutions will enable the future development of a new bridge to the doctorate training program that increases the presence of those underrepresented in plant sciences and engineering. To address the grand challenge of sustainable agriculture and global food security, this training program will create a diverse, interdisciplinary workforce empowered to engage with industry, grower, and academic partners. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program will bring together graduate students from multiple disciplines interested in design and engineering for sustainability to solve real-world problems and increase climate resilience. This project will offer students not only core technical education and training opportunities but important soft skills to become inclusive and responsible future workforce. It will foster collaborations and support immersive experiences for trainees and build a diverse community in STEAM fields. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. The United Nations predicts a global population beyond 9 billion by 2050, requiring at least doubling current food production. However, half of our planet's habitable land is already used for agriculture with little left for new farms. As such, food productivity must increase in order to grow more food within the land we have. Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) offers a great potential solution â€“ in this type of indoor farming, plants grow in oxygenated, fertilizer-rich hydroponics rather than soil, allowing growers to optimize plant nutrition. Paired with the precise control of environmental conditions enabled by indoor cultivation, plants can exhibit enhanced productivity in hydroponic systems and can be cultivated at higher areal densities in vertical configurations. Further, agricultural digitization can help improve efficiency, resilience, and sustainability of commercial vertical farming by opening the door to implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) for automation, real-time monitoring and control, and exploitation of massive amounts of data, promising deeper fundamental understanding of both plant physiology and performance within an engineering context. In this project, AI4OPT-AG, established by Georgia Tech, will lead an exploratory multi-national research network with targeted institutions in Japan, Australia, and India to collaborate and accelerate innovations in digital agriculture and optimization, and bolster food security for our future. High-fidelity digital-twin-based approaches to digitization, and further, in-silico optimization, remain nascent in agriculture and the life sciences more broadly. This cultivation modality presents a useful platform for the study of living, dynamic, cyber-physical systems, with the implementation of hydroponic rather than soil-based configurations enabling direct, near-instantaneous control of the plant growth environment. Two specific next-generation techniques, hyperspectral imaging and gas chromatography fingerprinting of plant signaling molecules, could unlock valuable fundamental insights into plant physiology, but generate massive datasets requiring efficient processing to generate actionable insights. Innovations in digital agriculture, particularly in the engineering and integration of artificial intelligence (AI), biofeedback, and robotics could accelerate both knowledge generation and technology development. The primary challenges associated with this approach arise from the massive quantity of data, and the heterogeneity in data modality, quality, resolution, frequency, and complexity. There is also an opportunity to hybridize modeling approaches beyond purely data-driven or first- principles- based approaches. Such a hybrid approach may improve capabilities beyond those of its individual components, with first principles based physiological models providing fundamental constraints, transparency, and a tether to ground truths, while data-driven approaches provide data augmentation, unparalleled fitting abilities, and efficient management of high dimensional data. We are developing novel approaches to manage, integrate, exploit, and optimize these disparate, and often sparse data streams to enable rapid, computationally efficient techniques to support control and optimization applications. Although robotics and automation are valuable paths towards rapid feedback and high-throughput data collection in vertical farming operations, innovations in AI are crucial to enable rapid, accurate, high-throughput, non-destructive plant status determinations as a platform for performance optimization. This award is supported as part of the Quad AI-ENGAGE initiative to advance innovation through critical technologies to empower next generation agriculture. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Globally, food systems are responsible for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions and over 85% of water consumption, fueling climate change and negative environmental impacts. In the US, approximately 30% of the food produced goes to waste, while over 10% of households experience some level of food insecurity, largely in underrepresented communities. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can revolutionize the US food and agriculture sector across the food value chain, â€œfrom farm to fork,â€ to meet the growing needs for environmental sustainability and climate resilience, while ensuring equitable access to healthy food for all Americans. Before AI tools and applications are deployed widely in the food and agricultural sector, it is critical to understand needs, concerns, and potential impacts on stakeholders in the sector. The proposed convenings will assemble experts in AI and food systems and stakeholders in the food and agriculture sector to discuss how AI technology should be designed, developed, and deployed in the sector and how the sectorâ€™s workforce can be trained to support the responsible and ethical use of AI across the food value chain. The convenings will emphasize AI that helps food systems address three societal challenges: environmental sustainability, climate resilience, and equitable access to healthy food. Convening objectives are to: 1) raise awareness and identify approaches and needs for AI to address societal challenges in food systems; 2) create education and workforce training recommendations to support responsible and ethical AI use in food systems; 3) convene stakeholders across the food value chain to build cross-sector teams to achieve objectives 1 and 2; and 4) identify potential model projects and agendas for involving stakeholders in AI design, development, and deployment in food systems to minimize harm across the technology life cycle. The convenings will include five online Communities of Practice in January -February 2025 and an in-person Workshop in May 2025, with facilitated discussions to generate recommendations and develop partnerships that build towards the conveningsâ€™ objectives. Participants will include experts in AI and food systems and stakeholders from across the food value chain. Output from the Communities of Practice and Workshop will be presented to the public in an online Symposium in September 2025 for a final round of feedback. Final products of the convenings will include a Responsible Design, Development, Deployment of Technology (ReDDDoT) model for AI in food systems that can inform NSFâ€™s ReDDDoT needs and priorities for other sectors and technologies. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Cornell University will develop an interdisciplinary graduate training and research program on AI for Sustainability Sciences and Engineering (AISSE), focusing on decarbonizing energy and agri-food systems. The project addresses the urgent need for innovative solutions to sustainability challenges, such as climate change, highlighted by the record-breaking global average temperature in July 2023. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, the NRT seeks to cultivate a skilled workforce proficient in both AI and sustainability, responding to the increasing demand in these rapidly evolving fields.

This interdisciplinary effort also partners with five minority-serving institutions and several Cornell research centers specializing in AI, sustainability, digital agriculture, and energy systems, aiming to equip trainees with the technical and professional skills to address scientific, societal, and workforce needs. The AISSE NRT program will develop advanced AI methodologies to create sustainable materials, decarbonize energy systems, enable climate-smart food production, and analyze the energy-food-climate nexus. These research efforts will tackle forefront scientific and societal challenges while advancing transformative AI methodologies. Key training elements of the NRT include a small-grant initiative, a rigorous practicum program, and an immersive bootcamp combining a crash course with a team-science workshop. The curriculum will feature harmonized courses, cross-field lab rotations, and joint mentorships to promote interdisciplinary research training. Additionally, the program emphasizes developing professional skills in scientific communication, team science, ethics, leadership, and entrepreneurship. Expected outcomes include creating new AI tools and methods, advancing sustainability science and engineering, and preparing graduates with interdisciplinary expertise and professional skills. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative education, the AISSE NRT aims to produce a workforce capable of using AI to tackle sustainability and decarbonization challenges, ensuring long-term impact. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Black diasporic farming communities are important sites of sustainable food production for millions of people in the US and worldwide. As tight-knit agricultural collectives, they generate food throughout cities, promote diasporic values of ecological well-being, resource conservation, and interdependence, and foster the possibility of social and political transformation for black, indigenous, racialized and marginalized groups. While advancements in food security, nutrition, and environmental health have the potential to feed nearly twice as many people per year, particularly among historically marginalized groups, black diasporic urban farming communities face several hurdles to efficiency that remain largely under-addressed. Activities such as risk management, soil health monitoring, and crop harvesting rely on repeated, time-consuming work that is challenging to support on limited budgets, resources, and labor. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) promises solutions to many of these challenges, making the case for an emerging market around AI-driven agricultural technologies. This project aims to (1) advance understanding of sociotechnical ecosystems involving AI to support diasporic urban farming; (2) collaboratively develop AI-based technologies that better integrates and sustains technological gains with diasporic knowledge, and (3) systematically assess the impact of AI-based farming technologies on diasporic communities and industrial partners. In particular, our research seeks to advance the field of smart agriculture for diasporic urban farming communities along three urgent axes: (1) Labor: Addressing labor needs, decreasing bias within weeding, and ensuring access to affordable services for farmers who need them; (2) Ecosystem: Advancing care for a farmâ€™s ecological conditions by supporting synergistic relationships with the land and surrounding organisms, training novice farmers, and monitoring greenhouse conditions; (3) Health: Innovating mechanisms for healthy soil conditions, reducing toxicity, and increasing the quality and quantity of nutrients. This work unfolds across three phases. Phase 1 begins with an ethnographic case study involving participant observation of urban agricultural practices and semi-structured interviews with partner organizations and identified stakeholders. Phase 2 complements this empirical work with an evaluation and design study that identifies sociotechnical solutions for agricultural decision-making informed by black diasporic needs. Phase 3 involves technical implementation that mindfully integrates black diasporic knowledge with AI-based technologies towards a smart and connected diasporic farming infrastructure. This work relies on our interdisciplinary teamâ€™s close collaboration with three farming organizations, three industry partners, and sustained partnerships across wider diasporic farming networks, and oversight from experts in AI, HCI, critical geography, urban studies, and community-based inquiry. This project is partially funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which is committed to funding research and practice with continued focus on investigating a range of informal STEM learning (ISL) experiences and environments that make lifelong learning a reality. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. The project aims to develop models for analyzing artificial intelligence (AI) robotsâ€™ (AI agents) motivations and behaviors and to understand their diverse relationships as they cooperate and adapt to the needs and behaviors of humans and other AI agents. The projectâ€™s novelty is its focus on modeling cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) from the cognitive science perspective and investigating how they reach consensus and integrate human needs through a shared needs-oriented trust network in the interaction. The projectâ€™s impacts are in advancing artificial social systems (like multi-robot systems and self-driving cars) in human society and to help them to work harmoniously with us, supporting sustainable human development. Moreover, the success of this project could enable cognitive modeling for cooperability-aware MAS of advanced AI architectures and software, leading to new technologies and applications in the computing, communications, electronics, aerospace, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries. The lead research investigator is engaging in outreach activities involving teachers and K-12 students through hands-on exposure to advanced AI and robotics technologies. The projectâ€™s three main objectives are to (1) design self-regulating AI agents with self-goal setting, self-monitoring, self-instruction, and self-reinforcement learning abilities, (2) design multi-sensor AI agents and corresponding communication protocols that will allow the robots to quantify their needs, recognize their innate values, and reach a consensus through negotiation, and (3) build an interface to share human needs with robots in real-time, guaranteeing human and AI agents interact in the same needs-oriented trust network. Finally, the project combines the characteristics of three models into a single system and analyzes how robots interact within a multi-robot testbed. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This project is an ExpandAI Capacity building pilot (CAP), which focuses on establishing and growing AI related activities at Texas State University - San Marcos. This project aims to significantly expand access to AI education, infrastructure, and research opportunities through widespread integration of AI technology into non-AI disciplines such as criminal justice, psychology, firefighting and agriculture. By leveraging the collective expertise and resources of the team, the project will promote interdisciplinary research and education to grow a diverse pool of AI practitioners that will drive sustainable expansion of AI technology across the Texas State University San Marcos campus and in the nearby community. Led by a diverse team of researchers from various academic departments, the project will catalyze institutional change at Texas State University San Marcos by providing comprehensive training to underrepresented individuals, empowering them to pursue AI-related careers thereby enriching the field with diverse perspectives.

A crop's traits and 3D structure (the shape and architecture of plants, including both above- and below-ground parts) are the attributes that chiefly influence crop growth and yield and provide critical evidence for plant phenotyping (the characterization assessment of plant traits). Crop yield predictions can be made by assessing 3D plant structures using crop sensing methods. However, crop sensing results at different scales are usually analyzed in isolation, which overlooks essential connections. Moreover, while root systems play a central role in plant functions, current methods mainly assess crops based on above-ground crop structure due to the difficulty of accessing roots. Current methods use satellites for remote sensing and drones for local sensing, enabling crop assessment at varying scales; however, it is difficult to integrate these observations effectively, and the information stream is formidable. The overarching objective of this project is to develop a novel AI infrastructure to integrate these observations to model and assess 3D crop structures at multiple scales and enhance below-ground sensing capabilities. Using this infrastructure, 3D crop structures can be estimated accurately at the individual, farm, and satellite scales, facilitating crop assessment and yield prediction. The project dramatically enhances and accelerates the ability of growers and agronomists to assess critical crop field structural variation for both above- and below-ground components, enabling large-scale crop management. This project also benefits students, from the high school to the Ph.D. level, by applying multi-scale 3D models of above- and below-ground crop structures to immersive education methods (Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and online learning), which are well-suited to solving the challenges of distance learning, especially for subjects like agriculture requiring field study. The multi-scale sensing system is also capable of estimating 3D landscape structures and large-scale crop structures and can be utilized in other areas, such as Arctic Sea ice modeling, forestry, and climate change studies. This project aims to connect a plantâ€™s structural phenotypes below- and above- ground and link in-situ measurements to satellite sensing data, thus enabling non-destructive crop root sensing and root-system status estimation based on observation of plant growth above-ground while at the same time empowering satellite images to assess these factors to furnish more local and detailed information. This project establishes a method for 3D crop sensing of individual plants, crop fields, and satellite regions to provide multi-scale crop structural evidence for crop assessment and yield prediction. This project also develops a novel AI neural network to sense root structures and predict traits based on sensing above-ground plant structures. This project investigates methods for satellite-based 3D sensing and nondestructive below-ground root sensing. Novel AI infrastructures are explored to address critical issues in computer vision and remote sensing, efficient integration of multi-scale sensing, 3D structure prediction, and spatial-temporal 4D inference. Such an approach can lower the ceiling for operational adoption of satellite and in-situ imagery assessments, based on a scientifically underpinned, multi-scale, 3D assessment workflow. In addition to its essential and practical implications for agriculture professionals, this project also explores novel AI solutions within computer vision and remote sensing. Crop structures are highly diverse, complicated, and changing phenomena. Therefore, agriculture presents an ideal research domain for investigating novel AI methods. This research advances AI by 1) largely improving the fusion effectiveness of various remote sensing modalities from sensors mounted on different devices, 2) significantly enhancing the learning capability by connecting sensing outputs expressed in multiple scales, 3) enabling 3D structure prediction for objects across different domains, and 4) providing future status prediction based on 4D spatial-temporal neural networks. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have entered the â€œmulti-tenantâ€ era, where multiple deep neural network (DNN) models are executed simultaneously. This involves concurrent deployment, computation, and interaction of multiple DNN models, increasing computational complexity and triggering new challenges: (1) How can a scalable and flexible computing architecture be realized that can adaptively host heterogeneous and concurrent DNN models? (2) How can computing flexibility requirements in multi-tenant DNN scenarios be met? (3) How can an efficient, end-to-end toolchain for building next-generation AI applications be realized in this context? This project addresses these challenges through three research thrusts: Thrust 1 investigates a novel processing-in-memory (PIM)-assisted graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture with innovative multi-tenant support, addressing important resource contention and model interaction issues. Thrust 2 explores dedicated GPU- and PIM-oriented scheduling techniques to enhance the platformâ€™s performance. Finally, thrust 3 further enhances the multi-tenant AI application development cycle with algorithm optimization and code deployment support. With the successful completion of these thrusts, this project can achieve breakthroughs in modern AI computing and support the next generation of AI applications. The proposed techniques have the potential to accelerate AI design and deployment, spurring even wider AI utilization. This can contribute to important application areas with societal importance, including autonomous driving, metaverse immersion, smart agriculture, and industrial infrastructure. This project will also benefit students --and by consequence, society-- by incorporating research results within relevant courses, increasing the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in computing, and sharing research results with researchers, companies, and government agencies. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Although the world is witness to the tremendous successes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in some domains, many domains have yet to reap the benefits of AI due to the lack of easily usable AI infrastructure. The NSF AI Institute for Intelligent Cyberinfrastructure with Computational Learning in the Environment (ICICLE) will develop intelligent cyberinfrastructure with transparent and high-performance execution on diverse and heterogeneous environments. It will advance plug-and-play AI that is easy to use by scientists across a wide range of domains, promoting the democratization of AI. ICICLE brings together a multidisciplinary team of scientists and engineers, led by The Ohio State University in partnership with Case Western Reserve University, IC-FOODS, Indiana University, Iowa State University, Ohio Supercomputer Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, San Diego Supercomputer Center, Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Utah, University of California-Davis, University of California-San Diego, University of Delaware, and University of Wisconsin-Madison. Initially, complex societal challenges in three use-inspired scientific domains will drive ICICLEâ€™s research and workforce development agenda: Smart Foodsheds, Precision Agriculture, and Animal Ecology. ICICLEâ€™s research and development includes: (i) Empowering plug-and-play AI by advancing five foundational areas: knowledge graphs, model commons, adaptive AI, federated learning, and conversational AI. (ii) Providing a robust cyberinfrastructure capable of propelling AI-driven science (CI4AI), solving the challenges arising from heterogeneity in applications, software, and hardware, and disseminating the CI4AI innovations to use-inspired science domains. (iii) Creating new AI techniques for the adaptation/optimization of various CI components (AI4CI), enabling a virtuous cycle to advance both AI and CI. (iv) Developing novel techniques to address cross-cutting issues including privacy, accountability, and data integrity for CI and AI; and (v) Providing a geographically distributed and heterogeneous system consisting of software, data, and applications, orchestrated by a common application programming interface and execution middleware. ICICLEâ€™s advanced and integrated edge, cloud, and high-performance computing hardware and software CI components simplify the use of AI, making it easier to address new areas of inquiry. In this way, ICICLE focuses on research in AI, innovation through AI, and accelerates the application of AI. ICICLE is building a diverse STEM workforce through innovative approaches to education, training, and broadening participation in computing that ensure sustained measurable outcomes and impact on a national scale, along the pipeline from middle/high school students to practitioners. As a nexus of collaboration, ICICLE promotes technology transfer to industry and other stakeholders, as well as data sharing and coordination across other National Science Foundation AI Institutes and Federal agencies. As a national resource for research, development, technology transfer, workforce development, and education, ICICLE is creating a widely usable, smarter, more robust and diverse, resilient, and effective CI4AI and AI4CI ecosystem.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. Communications and sensing have traditionally operated independently, utilizing separate frequency bands and hardware. The integration of these technologies, known as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), aims to enhance spectral, energy, and cost efficiency. ISAC designs find applications in wireless communications, localization, autonomous vehicles, area imaging, environmental monitoring, and more. However, achieving optimal ISAC designs solely through analytical approaches faces challenges due to performance trade-offs and complexity. To overcome these hurdles, this project employs artificial intelligence (AI) to design such solutions and establish theoretical foundations for ISAC. A unique European collaboration (Finland) unites diverse research expertise, fostering economic, societal, and research impacts. Knowledge transfer occurs through dissemination, curriculum development, student exchanges, and industry collaborations. The project also engages with farmers' markets to showcase ISAC's potential to benefit local agriculture. This project aims to explore the optimal integration of sensing and communications through AI-assisted ISAC designs. The research consists of three interconnected thrusts. The first thrust involves designing unified waveforms, constellations, and beamforming techniques for both sensing and communications. Additionally, AI-based channel learning and generation methods will be developed. The second thrust focuses on implementing ISAC designs using large aperture arrays. The project aims to establish the theoretical foundations of the extended near-field of ISAC channels with electrically large aperture arrays and leverage the unique channel characteristics to optimize integration gains. The third thrust is dedicated to real-time implementation and evaluation of the AI-assisted ISAC designs and algorithms, considering factors such as performance, robustness, and advancement metrics.

Internet of Things (IoT) is anticipated to comprise approximately 75+ billion interconnected devices by 2025. Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled IoT devices consist of sensory imaging systems that enable data collection from people and the environment. However, insufficient computing ability of small IoT devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, etc., and memory/compute-intensive AI tasks prevent AI techniques from being widely deployed in such devices. This proposal enables a smooth transition from the state-of-the-art cloud-centric IoT approach to a data-centric approach, enabling mobile edge devices to perform computation close to the sensor by repurposing the cache memory to a data-parallel processing unit. This will remarkably reduce the power consumption and latency of data transmission to the cloud. Moreover, this project seeks to design and deploy new hardware-oriented AI algorithms into edge devices for efficient image processing, reducing the computation complexity and memory access, while maintaining accuracy. With the technologies developed in this project, more powerful and stable IoT devices can be introduced ensuring accelerated operation with applications of societal importance spanning healthcare monitoring, automotive applications, industrial and agriculture sensing, intelligent infrastructure, etc. A comprehensive circuit-to-system assessment framework will be adopted to systematically evaluate the performance of the system on several IoT workload suites. This project will make a strong effort on developing undergraduate and graduate course modules, propagating transportable and open-source models, and broadening STEM participation through publications/presentations at conferences and workshops and involving undergraduate minority students. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to synthesize an intelligent polymer hydrogel, and to develop a wireless, remote and sensitive magnetoelastic sensor for rapid detection of avian influenza (AI) virus. The highly pathogenic AI strain H5N1 virus has caused hundreds of human deaths and billion dollars of economic loss per year. High sensitive techniques for early identification and eradication of AI viruses are urgently needed. The proposed smart material is expected to shrink and swell in the absence and presence of AI virus due to the crosslinking between single stranded DNA and aptamers and dissolution of the linkage in the polymer network. The shrinking and swelling of the hydrogel upon AI virus could be sensitively monitored with a wireless magnetoelastic mass-based sensor platform. The broader impacts of this research are on the development of new biosensing materials for rapid diagnostics in the fields of biology, agriculture, medicine and environment. It will open a new way to synthesize virus-responsive materials by introducing ssDNA and aptamers into polymer structures. Moreover, the proposed project is to improve influenza diagnostic technologies and to prevent avian influenza from spread between flocks or into the human population. The successful outcome of this research should provide direct economic benefits to poultry and food industries, promote diagnostic technologies, and improve human health. This proposed method has the potential to provide a rapid, low-cost, high sensitive and reliable solution for identification and detection of avian influenza as well as human and swine influenza. A sustainable energy supply is a critical driver for our nationâ€™s continued industrial and economic growth. Therefore, it is necessary to make current and future energy infrastructures more responsive and resilient. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award, led by North Dakota State University with collaborators: University of Arkansas - Fayetteville, University of Nevada - Las Vegas, and Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, aims to enhance technological progress and economic growth of the jurisdiction states and the nation, while creating a new generation of workforce ready for the era of AI. The unique challenges faced by the jurisdiction states, including dispersed populations, extreme weather conditions, weak positions in energy networks and/or agriculture-based economies, motivate the team to explore an AI-based framework capable of identifying the vulnerable elements in the energy and related infrastructure networks, quantifying the health of the energy infrastructure, and providing automated resilience strategies against the impacts of catastrophic failures for a secured energy supply. This project will overcome critical regional and national issues related to vulnerable energy systems by creating holistic solutions against the negative impacts of energy disruptions on complex interdependent infrastructure networks via the exploration of innovative AI, engineering, economics, and operations research methodologies. The interdisciplinary team, consisting of experts in industrial engineering, civil and environmental engineering, computer science (especially AI), electrical engineering (especially power systems), public policy and economics, will explore the related methodologies that will be widely disseminated and implemented in a broad cross-section of industries where AI can contribute. The collaborative effort will promote AI as an industry of the future and generate immediate tangible impacts on industries in desperate need of an AI-proficient workforce by offering an AI-related associate degree and minor programs. The team will also support early career faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, especially Native American and Hispanic participants from tribal and minority serving institutions. The intellectual merit goal of the Artificial Intelligence on Sustainable Energy Infrastructure Network (AI SUSTEIN) is to establish a collaborative research program to investigate the potential of AI as a driving force for bringing about radical changes to critical infrastructures and industries. AI SUSTEIN will conduct the following research activities: (1) understand and quantify the interdependency in infrastructure networks and perform risk and economic impact assessment on both the industrial and economic aspects using AI; (2) develop a decentralized AI-based health monitoring and failure prediction system of energy infrastructure using real-time data; and (3) create a strategic framework for improving the resilience of energy infrastructure and local industries via AI-enhanced maintenance planning, optimization, and decision-making. The broader impact goals of AI SUSTEIN are to 1) serve as a vital source of information and resources; 2) partner with all the stakeholders especially industries to ultimately form a research center in AI and data analytics, and 3) develop diverse workforce and empower them with necessary AI skills. AI SUSTEIN will engage in the following workforce development/educational efforts: (1) develop an interdisciplinary team-taught course on AI and data analytics in critical infrastructure and provide research training to students from tribal and minority serving institutions; (2) mentor and support junior faculty; (3) create and offer a technical assistance program for infrastructure industry on AI and big data approaches for real-time condition monitoring, maintenance planning, and reliability issues and partner with the industries to secure their commitment and support for establishing an NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center; and (4) facilitate and coordinate the formation of an associate degree program on AI at a tribal college and offer an AI minor at the participating universities. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. This project addresses a general class of machine learning problems involving loosely-coupled heterogeneous domains. Such problems have significant applications in various fields, from precision agriculture (plant genotype-to-phenotype) to precision medicine (genotype-disease associations) to ecology (soil moisture-climate interactions). Beyond the specific challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, an equally important and related challenge is diversifying the talent pool with the technical capability to these problems. The project has three specific goals: (1) develop methods for association pattern discovery in loosely-coupled domains; (2) perform information integration, prototype development, and evaluation of the methods developed; (3) capacity building in research and education in machine learning/artificial intelligence and their applications in precision agriculture at West Virginia State University (WVSU). The project includes two case studies. The first is on the genotype-to-phenotype problem in precision agriculture, specifically on fruit phenotypes in habanero pepper, an important fruit crop. The second will apply proposed learning models to the problem of mapping fruit phenotype to sensory perception, which is needed to predict taste and flavor in fruit crops. The project also involves capacity building efforts to improve research capability for faculty at WVSU, while providing research training for students. Educational activities include curriculum development in data literacy and research training in machine learning and data analytics for undergraduate and graduate students. Further, the project will educate faculty, students, and the public within the local region on innovations and trends in artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications. The project includes deliberate plans to involve minority students and faculty from WVSU, an HBCU (Historically Black College and University) with collaborators at West Virginia University (WVU), an R1 institution. By so doing, the project will improve data science literacy across the entire university at WVSU and to develop more of the studentsâ€™ skills in data-driven analysis. Identifying reliable patterns of association between seemingly disparate domains remains a core challenge at the foundation of data science and machine learning. Doing this when the domains involved are each complex, heterogeneous, and have enormous datasets is an even more arduous task. The project identifies a class of problems involving loosely-coupled heterogeneous domains, and propose an innovative framework for performing large-scale association discoveries across such complex domains. Our framework is built on a strong theoretical foundation, namely, the information bottleneck rooted in information theory. The project makes new theoretical contributions to the foundation of data science and machine learning by developing new methods for learning hidden associations across two heterogeneous domains, and for integrating information across such domains. The project also develops novel applications of the new learning methods to two specific problems in precision agriculture and crop phenomics. The proposed method of discovering association patterns under the identified class of loosely-couple domains can easily be modified for any member of this identified class. This class is quite general, and includes problems in various fields of human endeavor, from agriculture to precision medicine to ecology.

This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) grant supports research that contributes new knowledge in manufacturing process planning automation and promotes the progress of fundamental science in the fields of advanced manufacturing, computer science, mathematical modeling, and geometric reasoning. Hybrid manufacturing integrates different manufacturing processes in one system, enabling the creation of a ready-to-use functional part directly from raw or stock material. Hybridizing two advanced manufacturing processes, additive and subtractive manufacturing, potentially unleashes nearly full manufacturing capability by providing the freedom of adding and removing material in three-dimensional space. This permits the realization of part designs of complex shapes and functionality for a variety of applications. However, this extraordinary manufacturing capability also introduces unprecedented challenges in toolpath planning and motion control, impeding the broader application of hybrid manufacturing. This award supports fundamental research to explore and develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to facilitate smarter and better computer aided manufacturing (CAM) tools for hybrid manufacturing processes. The project advances the understanding of automated manufacturing toolpath planning and control and enables goal-oriented autonomous fabrication of parts of any geometry. This research advances digital manufacturing, enhances sustainability, and trains the future skilled workforce, which benefits the U.S. economy and society. The project benefits several industries such as aerospace, defense, healthcare, energy, agriculture, and others. This research lays out a new fully automated computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) framework for advanced High-Degree-of-Freedom (i.e., 5 or more axes operation) hybrid manufacturing processes. This framework leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for computer-aided design (CAD) geometry analysis and CAM toolpath planning and control. A generalized model for various manufacturing processes and the AI approach that provides the best solution is the thrust of this research. The data format of the model allows inherent support for AI methodology. New AI algorithms that are built on neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and reinforcement learning are investigated for automated toolpath planning. This work advances the knowledge base in advanced manufacturing by filling the knowledge gap on how human knowledge and production data can be harnessed and extended to realize new manufacturing capabilities. The research team plans to hybridize a 5-axis milling subtractive process and a 5-axis material extrusion/directed energy deposition type additive manufacturing process, explore the AI-CAM frameworkâ€™s capability to expand from one to two and then to multiple processes, and establish a standard training and testing methodology for AI-CAM for further expansion and generalization of the framework. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
